 Run ```npm install && npm start``` from the root folder
### 
Chnage dir to client, Run ```cd saloodo-client && npm install && npm start ```

Try login with any data in the db.json file.

As an example :
#### 
Biker : ``` "email": "biker7@gmail.com","password": "123123",```
#### 
Manager: ```   "email": "manager@gmail.com","password": "123123",```
###
if you run into gyp error on windows while doing npm install in the saloodo-client folder. Try the below

```npm install --global --production windows-build-tools```
####
Then 
```npm install node-sass```
This will take some time to complete. Run ```npm install && npm start``` after that!
